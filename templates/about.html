    <h2>Web Application Technologies</h2>
    <p>This web application was built using the Python and Javascript programming languages. 
    It uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/spacy/">spaCy</a> python library for natural language processing in order to parse learning 
    outcomes and identify verbs. Notably, alongside verbs which appear in infinitive form, 
    this allows for detection of any conjugated verb in a learning outcome. 
    Since the underlying models of the spaCy library are statistical, 
    the analyses delivered by this web application will also be statistical.</p>
    <p>The back-end of the application was built using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django framework</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/celery/">Celery</a>, for asynchronous task management.</p>
    <p>The front-end of the application was built using HTML 5, CSS 3 and 'vanilla' Javascript, using
    AJAX for asynchronous processing.
    The analysis charts are generated using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chartjs</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a> Javascript libraries.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Learning Outcome</dt>
    <dd>A statement of what the learner is expected to know, understand or be able to do on successful completion of a course or programme.
    <dt>Taxonomy</dt>
    <dd>A hierarchical model used to classify educational learning outcomes into levels of complexity and specificity.</dd>
    <dt>Taxonomy Level</dt>
    <dd>An integer denoting the hierarchical level of abstraction of the verb category within the taxonomy.</dd>
    <dt>Taxonomy Overlap</dt>
    <dd>The total number of unique instances across the taxonomy where a verb appears simultaneously in 2 categories. 
    For instance, a verb appearing in exactly 2 categories contributes a factor of 1 to the total overlap. 
    However, a verb appearing in exactly 3 categories contributes a factor of 3. </dd>
